## Static build:
- Builds on Linux (x86), Windows (x86) and Mac (x64)
- All executables run on Windows
- Fractals and Bode run on Mac; Die just prints first log output and then hangs
- No executable runs on Linux; like Die on Mac all print first log output and then hang

## All-in-one build:
- Builds on Linux, but executables don't work (same as with static build)
- Fails on Windows when linking Bode; symbol kBOX2D_NULLf not found; using MSVC 2013
- Fails on Mac when linking; a lot of symbols missing

## Shared build
- Builds on Linux, but executables don't work (same as with static build)
- Fails on Windows; a lot of symbols are missing when linking DLLs
- Fails on Mac; a lot of symbosl are missing when linking DLLs
