## Static build:
- Builds on Linux (x86), Windows (x86) and Mac (x64)
- All executables run on Windows and Mac
- No executable runs on Linux; like Die on Mac all print first log output and then hang

## All-in-one build:
- Builds on Linux, but executables don't work (same as with static build)
- Builds and runs on Windows, no linking issues (some ignorable linker warnings), all executables work
- Builds and runs on Mac, all executables work

## Shared build
- Builds on Linux, but executables don't work (same as with static build)
- Builds and runs on Windows, no linking issues, all executables work
- Builds and runs on Mac, all executables work


Conclusion:
- The build seems to be ok on all platforms
- All applications run on Windows and Mac, but not on Linux (neither x86 nor x64)
